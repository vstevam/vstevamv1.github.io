                    <p>Always present in my life, sports taught me that doesn't
                        matter if you are not gifted with special talent but with
                        hard work you can always improve your skills. The first sport
                        which started to forge me was basketball in the school a couple of
                        years later it leads me to my biggest passion the Gym those sports
                        introduced how important discipline and have a routine setup is
                        important to let you ahead and always improving.</p>

                    <p>Nutrition, something that comes up to improve my body
                        composition but the results were remarkable beyond my expectation
                        not just in my body but also to my mind. The appropriate amount
                        of nutrients, known what to eat, how to understand
                        the body and the response from each nutrient. I dug deep into this subject
                        setting for 2 years in a College to learn the core of our body and be able
                        to develop my own nutrition program.</p>

        <p>I'm from an industrial city, There weren't many IT opportunities at that time but I saw into the technology
            and the internet there are no more boundaries or limits. You can learn anything about everything you just
            need to be willing to sacrifice what you are for what you will become and the future is in your hands..</p>

        <p>Even having the best examples at home (my mom). I just learn how it is important too late negotiating 50
            thousand reais with the bank. What is the take away? It doesn't matter how much money do you earn,
            what matters, are you controlling the money or the money controls you?
            I started to study everything from the begin and understanding financial concepts that should be taught in
            the school. 
            <br/>
            I implemented a system into my family when comes to finance, we are a company, with a budget, estimation,
            emergency reserve, investments and a few more things but nothing complicated or time-consuming. After it, we
            discovered that we were blind but now we see.
